There are 4 folders:
Matlab_code: The code for generating training data and the code for displaying the reconstructed spectra and obtaining REQUIRER. For details, please see instruction.pdf
Python_code: The code for training and testing JTF-Net. For details, please see instruction.pdf
NMRPipe_code: The code for preprocessing NUS data and post-processing the reconstructed spectra. For details, please see instruction.pdf
NUS_data: The folder where your NUS data is saved.

Due to Github's file size limitations, we upload the full training dataset, trained models to Goole drive. Download link:
